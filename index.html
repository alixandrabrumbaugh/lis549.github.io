        Cassandra Cain
    </h1>
    <p>
        Cassandra Cain first appeared in the Batman #567 series as part of the historic <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_No_Man%27s_Land" target="_blank">"No Man's Land"</a></cite> event, designed and led by cartoonist Jordan B. Gorfinkel. This event, in which the U.S. government quarantines and cuts all ties with Gotham City following a magnitude 7.6 earthquake, had effects that reverberated throughout the Batman universe. Of greatest relevance here is the introduction of Cass Cain, who is portrayed as a mute courier under the tutelage of former Batgirl Barbara Gordon. Following the events of No Man's Land Cass Cain donned the mantle of Batgirl, starring in the first eponymous Batgirl ongoing series (written by Kelley Puckett and pencilled by Damion Scott).
