        Cassandra Cain
    </h1>
    <p>
        Cassandra Cain first appeared in the main Batman series as part of the historic <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_No_Man%27s_Land">"No Man's Land"</a></cite> event, designed and led by cartoonist Jordan B. Gorfinkel. This event, in which the U.S. government quarantines and cuts all ties with Gotham City following a magnitude 7.6 earthquake, had effects that reverberated throughout the Batman universe. Of greatest relevance here is the introduction of Cass Cain, who is portrayed as a mute courier under the tutelage of Barbara Gordon (formerly Batgirl). As the NML storyline progressed, Cass was revealed to be the daughter of infamous assassin David Cain
