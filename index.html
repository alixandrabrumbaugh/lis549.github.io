        Cassandra Cain
    </h1>
    <p>
        Cassandra Cain first appeared in Batman #567 as part of the historic <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_No_Man%27s_Land" target="_blank">"No Man's Land"</a></cite> event, designed and led by cartoonist Jordan B. Gorfinkel. This event, in which the U.S. government quarantines and cuts all ties with Gotham City following a magnitude 7.6 earthquake, had effects that reverberated throughout the Batman universe. Of greatest relevance here is the introduction of Cass Cain, who is portrayed as a mute courier under the tutelage of former Batgirl Barbara Gordon. Following the events of No Man's Land, Cass Cain donned the mantle of Batgirl, starring in the first eponymous Batgirl ongoing series (written by Kelley Puckett and pencilled by Damion Scott).

        While my reasons for admiring Cass Cain primarily revolve around her character growth and interactions with others, I'd be remissed not to mention what makes her a great superhero. Raised from birth to be a perfect assassin, Cass' father deprived her of all spoken and written language, instead communicating through body language and sparring. This unorthodox upbringing resulted in Cass' language centers being rewired to "read" human movement, giving her near-superhuman reflexes. Added to her extensive training in martial combat, she boasts skills which place her among the top hand-to-hand fighters in the DC Universe, outranking Batman himself.
