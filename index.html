        Cassandra Cain
    </h1>
    <p>
        Cassandra Cain first appeared in Batman #567 as part of the historic <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_No_Man%27s_Land" target="_blank">"No Man's Land"</a></cite> event, designed and led by cartoonist Jordan B. Gorfinkel. This event, in which the U.S. government quarantines and cuts all ties with Gotham City following a magnitude 7.6 earthquake, had effects that reverberated throughout the Batman universe. Of greatest relevance here is the introduction of Cass Cain, who is portrayed as a mute courier under the tutelage of former Batgirl Barbara Gordon. Following the events of No Man's Land, Cass Cain donned the mantle of Batgirl, starring in the first eponymous Batgirl ongoing series (written by Kelley Puckett and pencilled by Damion Scott).

        While my reasons for admiring Cass Cain primarily revolve around her character growth and interactions with others, I'd be remissed not to mention what makes her a great superhero. Raised from birth to be a perfect assassin, Cass' father deprived her of all spoken and written language, instead communicating through body language and sparring. This unorthodox upbringing resulted in Cass' language centers being rewired to "read" human movement, giving her near-superhuman reflexes. Added to her extensive training in martial combat, she boasts skills which place her among the top hand-to-hand fighters in the DC Universe, outranking Batman himself.

        Reasons to love Cass Cain
    </h2>
        <dl>
            <dt><b>Exploration of identity</b></dt>
            <dd>As with many adolescent protagonists, a large part of Cassandra's character arc involves exploring her identity. When her solo title starts up, she has placed her entire sense of self into being Batgirl, and by extension into living up to the mythos of Batman. This is the source of much conflict between Batman and Barbara Gordon, the former of whom believes that placing your entire sense of self into fighting crime is a perfectly healthy reaction to trauma and the latter who believes that maybe a teenage girl should have hobbies outside of beating up street criminals. As the book progresses, Cass by turns loses (temporarily) the mantle of Batgirl, embarks on her first date (largely at the insistance of Barbara), and navigates her first social experiences outside of the superhero world. Honestly, the book is full of more emotional and self-driven character development than I can do justice to here. The one thing I have to mention is the (dis)ability narrative - Cass' unique relationship to language places her in a position allegorical to everything from illiteracy to deafmuteness to autism, which are handled with a surprising (though not outstanding) level of tact and respect, especially considering the period in which the original run was published. Plus, she likes girls!</dd>
            
            <dt><b>Navigation of family trauma</b></dt>
            <dd>Unlike almost every other member of the Bat-family, Cassandra Cain has two biological parents who are both alive and well. Unfortunately, they're both professional assassins. In addition to Cass' inner conflict of her finely honed killing instinct and deep moral desire to "be good", she struggles with what she feels is a legacy of lethal violence. Family trauma is nothing new in the Batman canon, but watching Cassandra navigate her relationship with both her biological father David Cain and her adoptive father Bruce Wayne teaches some valuable lessons in accepting one's parents as flawed human beings, a crucial step in a coming-of-age narrative. We won't even get into her relationship with her mother here - suffice to say it takes the same concepts and amplifies them elevenfold.</dd>
            
            <dt><b>Continued relevance</b></dt>
            <dd>While Cassandra's original, much-loved solo title launched over twenty years ago, she continues to be a major presence in the Batman universe. Comics-wise, she was a major character of the 2016 run of <i>Detective Comics</i>, which spun off into her time as part of the 2018 <i>Batman and the Outsiders</i> run. More notably, she was the first "Batkid" to feature in a major motion picture since Chris O'Donnell's turn as the original Robin in <i>Batman Forever</i>, playing a prominent role in the 2020 <i>Birds of Prey</i> movie. She also starred in the fantastic kid's graphic novel "Shadow of the Batgirl" (2020), which sanitizes and streamlines her character's backstory for a younger audience while retaining the emotional heft of her family dynamics.</dd>
